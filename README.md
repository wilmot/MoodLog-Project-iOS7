====================

Utility for journalling your emotional state. Currently iPhone only. Minimum deployment target now iOS 9.

Welcome to Mood-Log

The Mood-Log app for iOS is designed to help you keep track of your emotions as they change throughout the day and from day to day. You do this by creating new Mood-Log entries, recording any emotions you are currently experiencing and other information about yourself. You can use Mood-Log as a journal to keep track of events in your life and watch for connections between your daily life and the emotions you experience. A summary page and charts show you whatâ€™s happening over time. You can send email reports from within Mood-Log and you can set reminders that will prompt you to create a Mood-Log entry at different times in the day.
